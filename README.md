## Want to see the site run?
To run the preview in GitHub Codespaces:
Install the packages by typing: `npm install`.
Type on the command line `$ npm run start` and type localhost on the browser.

## Troubleshooting

### I don't see my changes...

Everytime you change any file inside the `./src` folder the website's public URL will automatically refresh the changes (it's a process called hot deploy)
Remember also to refresh cleaning the cache (`command+shift+r` on Mac, `control+shift+r` on PC & Linux)

### How do I include more images in my project?

Add them inside the `./src/assets/img` folder and import them from any of your JS files. E.g: `import "../assets/img/rigo-baby.jpg";`

### How do I include more JS files?

Just add the files into the src folder and import the file/variables into your app.js. E.g: `import myVar from "./file2.js"`

### How do I publish the website?

This boilerplate is 100% compatible with the free GitHub pages hosting. Publish your website by running:

```bash
$ npm run deploy
```

Very easy and in just one step!  Push to your __main__ branch and use the free hosting that comes with [GitHub pages](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/#enabling-github-pages-to-publish-your-site-from-master-or-gh-pages), the project is ready to be published. Remember to choose to run the Github Page from your main branch.
