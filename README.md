## Troubleshooting

### I don't see my changes...

Every time you change any file inside the `./src` folder the website's public URL will automatically refresh the changes (it's a process called hot deploy)
Remember also to refresh cleaning the cache (`command+shift+r` on Mac, `control+shift+r` on PC & Linux)

<!-- ### How do I publish the website?

This boilerplate is 100% compatible with the free GitHub pages hosting. Publish your website by running:

```bash
$ npm run deploy
```

Very easy and in just one step!  Push to your __main__ branch and use the free hosting that comes with [GitHub pages](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/#enabling-github-pages-to-publish-your-site-from-master-or-gh-pages), the project is ready to be published. Remember to choose to run the Github Page from your main branch.
